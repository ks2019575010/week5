Vi Commands
vi commands are used in"screen"mode (the default),where
you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-
form operations on the next.

Most vi commands follow a general pattern:

or the equivalent form:
[number][command]textobject

"words."The lowercas commands define a words as a contig-

case commnds define a word as a contiguous sequence of 
nonwhitepace characters.
